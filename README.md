# VTEX IO Store Component Template

This demo component shows you how to make a simple yet complete VTEX IO store component.

It shows a simple demonstration of the following features:

- Declaring a component interface in `store/interfaces.json`.
- Declaring a schema to receive props via Storefront.
- Using the `messages` feature to have localized strings.
- Using an NPM package like `react-intl`
- Using another VTEX IO App like `vtex.styleguide`.
- Using CSS Modules to make your component customizable via CSS on a store theme.
- Using tachyons tokens to quickly style your components.
- Creating tests for your VTEX IO app.
